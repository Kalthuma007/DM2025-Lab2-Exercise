    "The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include customer transaction records, website logs, sensor data, social media feeds, scientific experiment results, and much more.\n",
      "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, correlations, anomalies, and relationships within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain observed phenomena.\n",
      "*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The ultimate aim is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works (The Process):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining is usually an iterative process that involves several stages:\n",

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the discovered knowledge into practice. This could involve integrating it into business processes, creating reports, or building predictive models.\n",

      "Data mining employs a variety of techniques, often drawing from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Some of the most common include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
      "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",

      "Joy and surprise are distinct emotions that manifest differently and thus require careful consideration in emotional modeling, especially within the context of social media sentiment analysis. While both can be positive, their underlying mechanisms, eliciting factors, and behavioral expressions are unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of their differences in emotional modeling and social media sentiment analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Joy:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sustained Positive Affect:** Joy is generally a longer-lasting, more stable positive emotion. It's characterized by feelings of contentment, happiness, pleasure, and well-being.\n",
      "*   **Absence of Threat:** Often arises in situations where there's a sense of security, fulfillment, or achievement.\n",
      "*   **Focus on Presence or Anticipation:** Can be experienced in the moment (e.g., enjoying a good meal) or in anticipation of positive future events (e.g., looking forward to a vacation).\n",
      "*   **Behavioral Manifestations:** Smiling, laughing, increased energy, prosocial behaviors, expressive vocalizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Emotional Modeling Perspective:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dimensional Models:** Falls on the positive valence and high arousal spectrum, often considered a high-arousal positive emotion but can also exist in a lower arousal, serene state of contentment.\n",
      "*   **Categorical Models:** A distinct category representing happiness and positive affect.\n",
      "*   **Cognitive Appraisal:** Often triggered by events that are appraised as beneficial, desirable, or aligned with personal goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social Media Sentiment Analysis Perspective:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Keywords and Phrases:** Look for explicit expressions of happiness: \"happy,\" \"joyful,\" \"excited,\" \"thrilled,\" \"amazing,\" \"wonderful,\" \"love it,\" \"blessed,\" \"grateful.\"\n",
      "*   **Emoji Usage:** 😊, 😄, 😂, ❤️, ✨, 🎉, 🥳.\n",
      "*   **Contextual Clues:** Posts about achievements (promotions, graduations), positive life events (weddings, births), enjoying leisure activities, expressing gratitude.\n",
      "*   **Intensity:** Joy can range from mild contentment to intense euphoria. Models need to capture this range.\n",
      "*   **Durability:** Joyful sentiments are often more sustained in text, indicating a lingering positive state.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Surprise:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sudden and Transient:** Surprise is a very brief, intense emotional response to an unexpected event. It's a primal reaction to novelty.\n",
      "*   **Orienting Response:** Its primary function is to grab attention and facilitate rapid information processing.\n",
      "*   **Neutral Valence (Initially):** The initial surprise itself is often neutral. Its valence (positive or negative) is determined by the subsequent appraisal of the unexpected event.\n",
      "*   **Behavioral Manifestations:** Wide eyes, raised eyebrows, open mouth, gasping, sudden stillness, followed by other emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Emotional Modeling Perspective:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dimensional Models:** High arousal, but valence is context-dependent. Can be categorized as a \"surprise\" dimension.\n",
      "*   **Categorical Models:** A distinct category representing unexpectedness.\n",
      "*   **Cognitive Appraisal:** Triggered by events that violate expectations, are novel, or are incongruent with existing schemas. The subsequent appraisal of the event determines the follow-up emotion (e.g., surprise leading to joy, fear, or confusion).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social Media Sentiment Analysis Perspective:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Keywords and Phrases:** \"OMG,\" \"wow,\" \"whoa,\" \"unbelievable,\" \"can't believe it,\" \"no way,\" \"surprising,\" \"unexpected,\" \"shocked\" (though \"shocked\" leans towards negative surprise).\n",
      "*   **Punctuation and Capitalization:** Frequent use of exclamation marks (!!!), all caps (OMG), and question marks (???) to convey intensity and disbelief.\n",
      "*   **Emoji Usage:** 😲, 😮, 😳, 🤯, 😱 (often for negative surprise).\n",
      "*   **Contextual Clues:** Reactions to unexpected news, plot twists in movies/books, sudden gifts, shocking events, or surprising announcements.\n",
      "*   **Temporal Aspect:** Surprise is inherently linked to a sudden onset. Sentiment analysis might look for shifts in sentiment or sudden spikes in engagement that are indicative of a surprising event.\n",
      "*   **Ambiguity:** Surprise often needs further context to determine its positive or negative valence. A \"wow\" can be positive (e.g., \"Wow, what a beautiful view!\") or negative (e.g., \"Wow, that was a terrible accident.\").\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Distinguishing Between Initial Surprise and Subsequent Emotion:** A post might start with \"OMG!\" (surprise) but then express immense joy or extreme disappointment. Models need to look beyond the initial marker.\n",
      "*   **Sarcasm and Irony:** Surprise can be expressed sarcastically, masking underlying negative emotions. For example, \"Oh, *surprise*, another price increase.\"\n",
      "*   **Context Dependence:** The same words or emojis can signal joy or surprise depending on the surrounding text and the user's past behavior.\n",
      "*   **User-Specific Language:** Different users may have unique ways of expressing these emotions.\n",
      "*   **Intensity Nuances:** Differentiating between a mild pleasant surprise and an overwhelming, jaw-dropping surprise is difficult but important for nuanced analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While both joy and surprise are positive in their potential outcomes, joy is a more enduring state of happiness, while surprise is a momentary reaction to the unexpected. In social media sentiment analysis, identifying joy involves looking for explicit positive language and consistent positive sentiment, whereas surprise is often signaled by exclamations of disbelief, sudden shifts in tone, and intense, albeit brief, reactions. Effective emotional modeling must capture these fundamental differences to accurately interpret the complex landscape of human emotion expressed online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response from gemini-2.5-pro:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Here’s a detailed breakdown of how joy and surprise differ in emotional modeling, especially within the context of social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Difference: Valence and Predictability\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental distinction lies in two key dimensions of emotion:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Valence (Polarity):** This is the positive or negative quality of an emotion.\n",
      "    *   **Joy** is **unambiguously positive**. It is a high-pleasure emotion triggered by a desirable, positive outcome, or a pleasant experience.\n",
      "    *   **Surprise** is **valence-neutral**. It is a response to an *unexpected* event, regardless of whether that event is good, bad, or neutral. The feeling itself is one of being caught off-guard. The positivity or negativity comes from what *caused* the surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Trigger (Cause):**\n",
      "    *   **Joy** is triggered by achieving a goal, receiving good news, or experiencing something pleasurable. The event is *desirable*.\n",
      "    *   **Surprise** is triggered by a violation of expectation or a sudden, novel event. The event is *unexpected*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it this way: **Joy is the destination. Surprise is the sudden turn in the road that might lead to that destination, a car crash, or just a new, interesting scenic route.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparison Table: Joy vs. Surprise\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | Joy | Surprise |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Valence (Polarity)** | **Always Positive** | **Neutral / Variable** (can be positive, negative, or neutral) |\n",
      "| **Arousal (Intensity)**| High | High |\n",
      "| **Primary Trigger** | A desirable, positive event or outcome. | An unexpected or novel event. |\n",
      "| **Function** | To reinforce behavior, build social bonds, and signal well-being. | To focus attention on new, important information and prepare the body for a response. |\n",
      "| **Typical Keywords** | amazing, love, so happy, best, excited, brilliant, wonderful, yay | wow, omg, holy cow, really?, wtf, didn't see that coming, whoa, unexpected |\n",
      "| **Typical Emojis** | 😄, ❤️, 🎉, 😊, 😍, ✨ | 😲, 🤯, 😱, 😮, ‼️, ⁉️ |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why This Distinction is Crucial in Social Media Sentiment Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "On social media, text is short, context is minimal, and slang/emojis are rampant. Mistaking surprise for joy (or vice-versa) can lead to significant errors in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. The Ambiguity of \"Wow\" and \"OMG\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A model that conflates surprise and joy will misinterpret a huge volume of social media content.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Positive Surprise (leading to Joy):**\n",
      "    > \"OMG, the new update just added the feature I've wanted for years! 🎉 Thank you @ProductX!\"\n",
      "    *   **Correct Analysis:** Surprise + Joy. This is a huge win for the brand.\n",
      "    *   **Simple Model's Error:** Might just classify as \"Surprise\" or \"Positive,\" missing the powerful signal of user delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Negative Surprise (leading to Anger/Fear):**\n",
      "    > \"OMG, the new update just deleted all my files! 😱 @ProductX what is going on?!\"\n",
      "    *   **Correct Analysis:** Surprise + Anger/Fear. This is a critical customer service issue.\n",
      "    *   **Simple Model's Error:** A model that associates \"OMG\" with general excitement might misclassify this as non-negative, delaying an urgent response.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Neutral Surprise (leading to Curiosity):**\n",
      "    > \"Whoa, a Tesla just flew past my window. Didn't know they were testing that here.\"\n",
      "    *   **Correct Analysis:** Surprise. The user is simply noting an unexpected event.\n",
      "    *   **Simple Model's Error:** Might be ignored or misclassified depending on its training.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. The Power of Co-occurrence: \"Surprised Joy\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joy and surprise frequently appear together. This combination, often called **\"delight,\"** is one of the most powerful positive signals a brand can receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Post:** \"I ordered a book and it came with a free tote bag! I had no idea. This is amazing! 😲❤️\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   A **basic sentiment model** might just see \"amazing\" and classify it as \"Positive.\"\n",
      "*   A **good emotion model** will identify both **Surprise** (from \"had no idea\" and 😲) and **Joy** (from \"amazing\" and ❤️).\n",
      "*   **Why it matters:** This isn't just a happy customer; it's a customer whose expectations were positively exceeded. This is a strong indicator of brand loyalty and positive word-of-mouth. Modeling this combination allows a business to pinpoint exactly which actions are creating \"wow\" moments for their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Sarcasm and Irony\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprise-related language is often used sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Post:** \"Oh, wow. Another 2-hour outage. Just what I needed on a Monday. 🙄\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A naive model might see \"wow\" and be confused. A sophisticated model that understands context, and perhaps the eye-rolling emoji (🙄), will recognize this as **negative sentiment (annoyance/anger) expressed through sarcastic surprise.** It correctly identifies that the \"surprise\" is feigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Modeling Approaches and Solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "To handle these differences, sentiment analysis models have evolved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Lexicon-Based Models (Outdated for this task):** These use dictionaries of words tagged with emotions. They would fail miserably here, as \"wow\" or \"omg\" have no inherent positive or negative valence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Traditional Machine Learning (SVM, Naive Bayes):** These are better, as they learn from features in context. However, they can still struggle with the subtle nuances of short social media text.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Deep Learning (BERT, Transformers):** This is the state-of-the-art. These models excel because they are pre-trained on vast amounts of text and understand context deeply.\n",
      "    *   A BERT-based model can analyze the entire sentence: \"OMG, the **update deleted my files**\" vs. \"OMG, the **update is so fast**,\" and correctly determine the valence of the surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Multi-Label Classification:** Instead of forcing a post into a single emotion category (e.g., Joy OR Surprise), multi-label models can assign multiple emotions. The post \"OMG, I won! 😲🎉\" can be correctly tagged with **[Joy, Surprise]**. This captures the richness of the emotional experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In emotional modeling for social media, **joy is a signal of satisfaction**, while **surprise is a signal of novelty or a violation of expectation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Joy** tells you that you are *meeting or exceeding* positive expectations.\n",
      "*   **Surprise** tells you that you are doing something *unexpected*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal for any advanced sentiment analysis system is to first identify the surprise and then immediately look for contextual clues to determine its valence—is it a good surprise, a bad surprise, or just a neutral one? Getting this right is the difference between a system that simply counts positive/negative keywords and one that truly understands the voice of the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response with custom system prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent question. As a clinical psychologist specializing in emotion modeling, this distinction is at the heart of building more nuanced and human-like AI. The confusion between joy and surprise is a common pitfall in sentiment analysis, often leading to a flattened, inaccurate understanding of user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down the differences from both a psychological and a computational modeling perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Core Psychological Distinction\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we must understand that joy and surprise are fundamentally different emotional processes. I like to use an analogy:\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Joy is arriving at a long-awaited, desired destination. Surprise is having the road suddenly change, forcing you to re-evaluate the map.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the clinical breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | Joy | Surprise |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Valence** | **Consistently Positive.** Joy is an inherently pleasurable state. Its entire function is to signal that something good has happened, reinforcing the behavior or situation that led to it. | **Initially Neutral.** This is the most critical distinction. Surprise is an \"information-processing\" emotion. Its function is to halt all other processing and orient your attention to a novel, unexpected event. The valence (positive or negative) comes *after* the initial surprise, as you appraise the new information. |\n",
      "| **Arousal** | **High Arousal.** Characterized by high energy, motivation, and expressive behavior (smiling, laughing). It can range from serene happiness to ecstatic celebration. | **Very High Arousal (but brief).** It's a sharp, sudden spike in physiological arousal—the \"jolt.\" This spike is designed to make you instantly alert. |\n",
      "| **Causality** | **Caused by a *desired* outcome.** You feel joy when you achieve a goal, receive validation, connect with a loved one, or experience something you perceive as good. Expectation can play a role (e.g., expected joy at a wedding), but the core driver is positive goal attainment. | **Caused by an *unexpected* outcome.** The trigger is a \"schema violation\"—something happens that doesn't fit your current model of the world. It's about novelty and violated expectations, not inherent goodness. |\n",
      "| **Function** | **To Reinforce & Bond.** Joy encourages you to repeat behaviors that lead to positive outcomes and strengthens social connections through shared experience. | **To Reorient & Update.** Surprise forces you to stop, pay attention, and update your mental model with new, important information. It's a cognitive \"reset\" button. |\n",
      "\n",
      "The key takeaway is that **positive surprise** (e.g., an unexpected gift) is a sequence: **Surprise -> Appraisal (this is good!) -> Joy**. Many sentiment analysis models incorrectly label the entire event as just \"joy,\" missing the crucial initial phase of novelty and reorientation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Differing Footprints in Social Media Sentiment Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "When we translate this to the messy world of social media data, these psychological differences manifest in distinct linguistic and symbolic patterns. A sophisticated model must learn to spot these footprints.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Lexical Cues (The Words Used)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Joy:** Words are definitively positive and often reflect a state of being or gratitude.\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"happy,\" \"love this,\" \"grateful,\" \"blessed,\" \"amazing,\" \"celebrating,\" \"so proud,\" \"enjoying.\"\n",
      "    *   *Post:* \"So happy to announce I got the job! 🎉 So grateful for this opportunity.\"\n",
      "*   **Surprise:** Words express disbelief, novelty, and a violation of expectation.\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"whoa,\" \"omg,\" \"wow,\" \"can't believe,\" \"unexpected,\" \"suddenly,\" \"wait, what?\" \"no way.\"\n",
      "    *   *Post:* \"Whoa, did Apple just announce that? Did not see that coming.\"\n",
      "*   **The Ambiguous Zone (Positive Surprise):** This is where simple models fail. The language combines disbelief with positivity.\n",
      "    *   *Post:* \"OMG I WON?! 🤯 I can't believe it, I'm so incredibly happy right now! ❤️\"\n",
      "        *   A basic model sees \"won,\" \"happy,\" \"❤️\" and labels it `JOY`.\n",
      "        *   An advanced model sees \"OMG,\" \"?!\", \"🤯,\" \"can't believe it\" and recognizes the initial `SURPRISE`, followed by the resulting `JOY`. It might use a multi-label classification: `[surprise, joy]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Emoji Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "Emojis provide a powerful, direct signal that often clarifies ambiguous text.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Joy Emojis:** 😊, 😂, ❤️, 🎉, ✨, 🥰, 🥳, 🙏 (gratitude)\n",
      "*   **Surprise Emojis:** 😮, 🤯, 😱, 😳, 🤨\n",
      "*   **Positive Surprise Combos:** Often, you'll see a surprise emoji followed immediately by a joy emoji. This sequence is a goldmine for accurate modeling.\n",
      "    *   `😮🎉` (Wow, let's celebrate!)\n",
      "    *   `🤯❤️` (My mind is blown, and I love it!)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Syntactic & Contextual Cues**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Joy** posts are often declarative statements of fact or feeling.\n",
      "    *   \"We are having a baby!\"\n",
      "*   **Surprise** posts often contain questions, interjections, and fragmented syntax, mimicking the cognitive halt of the emotion itself.\n",
      "    *   \"Wait... are they really discontinuing that product?! No way.\"\n",
      "*   **Context is King.** The same word can mean different things. \"Incredible!\" after a team wins the championship is **joy**. \"Incredible!\" after a CEO suddenly resigns is **surprise** (and maybe fear or anger). A model must analyze the surrounding conversation and the nature of the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Implications for Emotional Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Moving Beyond Single Labels:** Simple classification into `positive`, `negative`, `neutral` is insufficient. Even basic emotion models (e.g., Ekman's 6: joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise) are better. The best approach is **multi-label classification**, where a single post can be tagged with both `surprise` and `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **The Value of Dimensional Models:** Models like the Valence-Arousal (VA) space are excellent for capturing this difference.\n",
      "    *   **Joy** lives squarely in the High-Valence, High-Arousal quadrant.\n",
      "    *   **Surprise** lives on the Y-axis: Neutral-Valence, High-Arousal.\n",
      "    *   A post like \"OMG I won!\" would show a trajectory in this space—a sharp spike up the arousal axis (surprise), immediately followed by a hard right turn into the positive valence quadrant (joy).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Training Data is Crucial:** To build a model that understands this, you cannot use training data where \"positive surprise\" is just labeled \"joy.\" You need meticulously labeled datasets that correctly identify the presence of surprise, even when it co-occurs with other emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while joy is a purely positive emotional state tied to desired outcomes, surprise is a fleeting, neutral, attention-grabbing mechanism triggered by the unexpected. In social media analysis, mistaking one for the other means missing the crucial story of a user's experience: were they simply happy, or was their world just momentarily and delightfully upended? Capturing that difference is key to creating truly emotionally intelligent systems.\n"

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "## Compare Zero-Shot, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-Shot\n",
    "- **Definition**: The model classifies without seeing any labeled examples, relying only on its pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "- **Results**:\n",
    "  - Accuracy is inconsistent, especially for nuanced emotions.\n",
    "  - Performs reasonably well on common categories (e.g., anger vs. joy).\n",
    "  - Struggles with subtle distinctions (e.g., fear vs. sadness).\n",
    "- **Observation**: Useful as a baseline when no labeled data is available, but prone to misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1-Shot\n",
    "- **Definition**: The model is given one labeled example per class.\n",
    "- **Results**:\n",
    "  - Accuracy improves compared to zero-shot.\n",
    "  - The single example helps the model understand the expected format and context.\n",
    "  - Performance is sensitive to the quality of the chosen example (if atypical, results degrade).\n",
    "- **Observation**: Better than zero-shot, but still limited by lack of diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5-Shot\n",
    "- **Definition**: The model is given five labeled examples per class.\n",

    "Zero-shot provides a baseline but misses subtle distinctions. One-shot improves performance but is highly dependent on the chosen example. Five-shot offers the most balanced and accurate classification, demonstrating the power of few-shot learning: even a handful of examples can dramatically improve performance without full-scale training.\n"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
